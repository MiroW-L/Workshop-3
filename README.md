## Working with Images (21/1/25)
- I am feeling really glad that for Workshop 2 I spent so long trying to to make images appear on my work, I hope that'll give me an advantage in this workshop.

## Geting started (22/1/25)
- I worked by using the Minutemen image I have previously used because I know how many pixels wide and tall it is which is helpful for calculating where pixels are, however what was super interesting for me in Leos video was using those square to generate specific pixel's colours into big squares and so I was messing around with those values and how it affected the image.
- One of the things I did was add a lot of rectanges whoich made it go crazy and generate at such a rapid rate it made my head hurt. I also added the blur affect to make it seem a little less visually agressive, I don't want it to be too harmful to watch, rather it to be mesmerising.

## The problem is that p5.js is not working with the image I'm using and that's really frustrating so I'll ask Leo about what I can do. And it's frustrating because I really enjoy working with images but being unable to use them on p5.js is disheartening, pushing me away from using images in my work.
